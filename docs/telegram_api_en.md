## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does VPN give an error?
Because Telegram checks if your IP country matches your phone number's country. Using tools that keep your IP in Iran helps avoid this issue.

### Is this method legal?
Yes, this method is solely for bypassing sanctions restrictions and accessing Telegram's official service.

### I got a `Too many attempts` error, what should I do?
Wait a few minutes and try again.
